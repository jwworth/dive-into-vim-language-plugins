# Dive Into Vim Language Plugins

These are the slides and code for a talk I'm giving at [Vim
Chicago](http://www.meetup.com/Vim-Chicago/) on April 19, 2016.

The subject is Vim Language plugins, focusing on
[Vim-Ruby](https://github.com/vim-ruby/vim-ruby).

A fictional language is discussed, called 'Emerald'.

### Setup

I load these slides into the buffer like so:

```
$ vim slides/*
```

Then, I advance through the deck with `:bn` or `]b`
([vim-unimpaired](https://github.com/tpope/vim-unimpaired)).
