### Keyword, Match, and Region

We had a question about the differences between `keyword`, `match`, and `region` in a Vim syntax highlighting file.

These three short chapters of 'Learn Vimscript the Hard Way' help explain:

http://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/chapters/46.html
http://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/chapters/47.html

TL;DR

* `keyword` assigns a variable name directly to a word or multiple words
* `match` assigns a variable name to a Vim regex
* `region` assigns a variable name to something between a "start" pattern and an "end" pattern
