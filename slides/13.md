# Access Modifier Indentation (cont.)

This is normal:

```ruby
class Indent
  public
  def method; end
  protected
  def method; end
  private
  def method; end
end
```

* With "indent", methods are indented inside access control keywords
* With "outdent", access control keywords are not indented inside classes
* "indent" is the most common style!
