"Terminal-based text editors take a lot of time and energy to learn and maintain. Simpler options have been available for years now (e.g. Sublime)."

* Check out every text editor
* Don't rule out Vim because it doesn't 'ship' with support for your favorite language. Find the right plugin!
* Use a plugin manager like Pathogen or Vundle
* Better tools == better work
